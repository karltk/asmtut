 x86 64-bit assembler tutorial
===============================

This project contains some material for a very short x86 64-bit assembler
tutorial. It was created for a workshop at Oslo Hackerspace, in Feb 2013.


 How to compile
================

You need to have the Netwide Assembler (nasm) and gcc installed.


# nasm -f elf64 program.asm
# gcc -o program program.o

for ass5

# gcc -o sdlhello sdlhello.o -lSDL


 How to debug
==============

You can use gdb. If you want to attach gdb to a running process (the -p option),
you must ensure that your user has privileges to attach to other processes.

# echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope
